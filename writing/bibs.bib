annote = {Framing: Is production adapted to comprehension? And if so, why?

In Experiment 1 they answer the first question in the positive. In experiment 2, three different accounts are tested against each other (they conclude their evidence supports 3. I think they were probably testing 1. and 2. against each other and then had to come up with a post hoc story why the evidence didn't turn out as expected):
Production is adapted to comprehension because...
1. "Listener-need" account (Gricean audience design type story)
2. Speaker experience account: production reflects speakers' own comprehension experience
3. Conceptual constraints: parallel processes for comprehension to conceptual structure as for conceptual structure to production

Test case: instrument omission. 
Methodology: production studies in a recall paradigm. Stories with different instruments and context are retold by subjects.

Experiment 1 
Method: 2x2, instrument typicality (typical or not) and importance (for the story - important vs unimportant)
Prediction: Atypical instruments should be mentioned more, important instruments should be mentioned more.
Results: More typical instruments ommitted more. Effect of importance only in 1 category: separate clause after verb.

Experiment 2 
Method: 2x2x2x2: instrument typicality, picture informativeness (informative: showing instrument, uninformative: not showing instrument), did speaker see picture before or after they read the passage, did listener see picture as speaker told story
Prediction: if listener-need account is correct, then typicality effect should disappear if listener gets instrument information from other source (ie sees picture). if speaker-experience account is correct, effect should disappear if speaker gets information from additional source
Results: somewhat more instrument mentions for ignorant hearers (some support for audience design). overall just big main effect of typicality. but also some support for availability-based production: more typical instruments tend to be mentioned BEFORE verb, less typical ones AFTER. this could also be a UID effect. 

Conclusion: They propose a box model with a quantitative component that builds on macro-propositions. There are multiple points of possible interference, that's why the results aren't directly pro audience design or pro speaker-need. They conclude that the default is to not specify instruments and only when necessary, mention them.

Problems: The model is strange. Typical box model stuff, unclear where it all comes from. Methodologically, it's not clear that the items are frequency-matched (they probably aren't), so it's hard to tell whether the effect is really due to typicality or just sth simple like frequency. Of course in this case one might argue that they should be highly co-linear, since we tend to talk more about more frequently occurring things (like knives, rather than ice-picks). However, they found precisely that more typical (and thus supposedly more frequently occurring) instruments are the ones that are ommitted more, so they should be talked about less (in these particular constructions) than less typical objects. 

Relation between frequency and predictability here?},

abstract = {A current debate in psycholinguistics concerns how speakers take addressees' knowledge or needs into account during the packaging of utterances. In retelling stories, speakers are more likely to mention atypical instruments than easily inferrable, typical instruments; in a seminal study, Brown and Dell (1987) suggested that this is not an adjustment to addressees but is simply easiest for speakers. They concluded that manipulating addressees' knowledge did not affect speakers' mention of instruments. However, their addressees were confederates who heard the same stories repeatedly. We had speakers retell stories to naive addressees who either saw or did not see a picture illustrating the main action and instrument. When addressees lacked pictures, speakers were more likely to mention atypical instruments, to mention them early (within the same clause as the action verb), and to mark atypical instruments as indefinite. This suggests that with visual copresence, speakers can take addressees' knowledge into account in early syntactic choices.},

abstract = {When people in conversation refer repeatedly to the same object, they come to use the same terms. This phenomenon, called lexical entrainment, has several possible explanations. Ahistorical accounts appeal only to the informativeness and availability of terms and to the current salience of the object's features. Historical accounts appeal in addition to the recency and frequency of past references and to partner-specific conceptualizations of the object that people achieve interactively. Evidence from 3 experiments favors a historical account and suggests that when speakers refer to an object, they are proposing a conceptualization of it, a proposal their addresses may or may not agree to. Once they do establish a shared conceptualization, a conceptual pact, they appeal to it in later references even when they could use simpler references. Over time, speakers simplify conceptual pacts and, when necessary, abandon them for new conceptualizations.},

To help evaluate this view, we can formalize it as the rational speech-act theory: Listeners assume that speakers choose their utterances approximately optimally, and listeners interpret an utterance by using Bayesian inference to "invert" this model of the speaker. We apply this framework to model scalar implicature ("some" implies "not all," and "N" implies "not more than N"). This model predicts an interaction between the speaker's knowledge state and the listener's interpretation. We test these predictions in two experiments and find good fit between model predictions and human judgments.},
annote = {on this one and Frank {\&}amp; Goodman 2012:

These papers are part of a more general push towards developing probabilistic models of pragmatic inference. The big ones have come from Amsterdam/Berlin/Tubingen (game-theoretic models that treat communicative settings as signaling games, rely on Bayesian update and iterated reasoning), the MIT/Stanford crowd around Mike Frank and Noah Goodman (Bayesian models that assume the listener has model of informative speaker), and more recently Ben Russell's thesis, where he derives implicatures probabilistically from a pretty complex theory of utterance interpretation.

Gricean Quantity reasoning:
1. The speaker could have produced the stronger alternative, which would have also been RELEVANT and more INFORMATIVE. 
2. If the speaker KNEW that the stronger alternative holds, she would have used the stronger alternative
3. The speaker is well-informed and HONEST
4. Thus the stronger alternative must not hold

Commonalities:
- pragmatic inference as social cognition: what other things could the speaker have said/done given what he knows
- assume that listeners have a model of the speaker, which in turn is assumed to be maximally informative given the literal meaning of utterances
- listeners then choose actions (interpretations) in proportion to the probability with which the speaker would have produced a particular utterance in a particular situation


Differences:
- 2012: referential expressions; assume full speaker access
- 2013: quantified statements; model limited access situations

What are the conditions that govern conversation? (In reaction to pure formalists.)

- distinction between what is said (sentence meaning) vs what is meant (speaker meaning) 
- hierarchy of meaning (total signification of an utterance, said/meant, implicated -{\&}gt; conventionally/conversationally, conversational implicature-{\&}gt; genearlized/particularized)

- conventional: consequence of expression's conventional meaning, not guided by rational principles of language use. not part of the truth conditions.

- conversational: arising from the cooperative principle. mutual assumption of rationality. different maxims guide different aspects of utterance choice:
- information conveyed: Quantity, Quality, Relevance
- form of information conveyed: Manner

- different ways to disobey maxims:
- violation. bad gricean behavior.
- opting out. make clear that your further behavior cannot be considered fully gricean.
- clash...
- flouting. get implicature by exploiting maxims. 

- GCI-PCI
- GCI: implicature arises unless blocked by context
- PCI: implicature arises in virtue of special fetaures of the context

- examples of different maxims:
- Quantity: south of france; good party? some friends.; letter of recommendation; indefinites
- Quality: irony, metaphor, meiosis, hyperbole
- Relevance: skiing example-{\&}gt; yes/no
- Manner: c-h-o-c-o-l-a-t-e, and

- features of conversational implicature: non-conventionality, calculability, non-detachability, cancelability, reinforceability (levinson), universality (levinson)

In the current paper, we study the production of definite target descriptions, and explore several factors that might influence the amount of information that is included in these descriptions. First, we present the results of a large-scale experiment investigating referential overspecification as a function of the properties of a target referent and the communicative setting. The results show that speakers (both in written and oral conditions) tend to provide more information when a target is plural rather than singular, and in domains where the speaker has more referential possibilities to describe the target. However, written and spoken referring expressions do not differ in terms of semantic redundancy. We conclude our paper by discussing the implications of our empirical findings for pragmatic theory and for language production models. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

Recent experimental research has shown evidence of very rapid effects of referential context in resolving local indeterminacies on-line. However, there has been no consensus regarding the nature of these context effects. The current paper summarizes recent work covering a range of phenomena for which referential contrast has been shown to influence on-line processing, including prenominal and post-nominal modification, focus operators, and intonational focus. The results of the body of work suggest that referential context effects are not limited to situations in which the linguistic form of the utterance directly specifies the point of contact with context. Rather, context effects of a pragmatic, Gricean nature appear to be possible, suggesting the relationship between linguistic form and context in rapid on-line processing can be of a very indirect nature.},

Dale and Reiter's Incremental Algorithm (IA) is often thought to be the best algorithm for maximizing the similarity to referring expressions produced by people. We test this hypothesis by eliciting referring expressions from human subjects and computing the similarity between the expressions elicited and the ones generated by algorithms. It turns out that the success of the IA depends substantially on the ''preference order'' (PO) employed by the IA, particularly in complex domains. While some POs cause the IA to produce referring expressions that are very similar to expressions produced by human subjects, others cause the IA to perform worse than its main competitors; moreover, it turns out to be difficult to predict the success of a PO on the basis of existing psycholinguistic findings or frequencies in corpora. We also examine the computational complexity of the algorithms in question and argue that there are no compelling reasons for preferring the IA over some of its main competitors on these grounds. We conclude that future research on the generation of referring expressions should explore alternatives to the IA, focusing on algorithms, inspired by the Greedy Algorithm, which do not work with a fixed PO.},

abstract = {This article investigates the effect of 2 language-in-use factors on the introduction and maintenance of referents in instructive discourse. These factors, implemented as conditions in an instructive production task, were the assumed visual identity for the reader of the objects or referents to be referred to in the instructions (visually same vs. visually different) and the assumed goal of the reader (reading to do vs. reading to learn). The results show that both factors have a strong impact on the writers' referential behavior. Visually same referents are introduced and reintroduced fairly systematically by means of perceptually overspecified NPs. Visually different referents are introduced systematically by extra propositional identification speech acts and they are reintroduced more often by attenuated anaphoric expressions. Apart from that, writers show a number of referential strategies which fit in with the assumed reader's goal. Writers in the reading to learn condition use more overspecified expressions than writers in the reading to do condition. The results contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the factors that determine the form of referential expressions in discourse. Referential expressions which are more informative than necessary for identification purposes do not only occur when the activation level of discourse referents is low, but also when the writer anticipates specific conditions in which the information will be used by the reader.},

abstract = {Written by highly respected theorists in psychology and philosophy, the chapters in this book explicate and address fundamental epistemological issues involved in the problem of the relationship between the individual and the collective. Different theoretical viewpoints are presented on this relationship, as well as between the nature of rationality and morality, relativism and universalism, and enculturation and internalization. Many chapters also highlight similarities and differences between these alternative frameworks and Piaget's theory, and thus correct the misperception that Piaget had nothing to say about the social dimension of development. Other chapters focus on the implications of these debates for the important topic areas of pedagogy, moral development, and the development of social understanding in infancy and childhood. Although Piaget's theory is presented and evaluated by some of the chapters in this collection, the authors remain critical and do not shy away from revising or extending Piaget's theory whenever it is deemed necessary. Though the topic covered in this book is of fundamental importance in the social sciences, it is rarely addressed in a sustained way as it is in this collection of chapters. The book benefits social scientists interested in fundamental epistemological issues, especially as these concern the relationship between the individual and the collective, with implications for the conceptualization of morality and rationality.},

abstract = {We investigated the time course of conjunctive ''same''–''different'' judgements for visually presented object pairs by means of combined reaction time and on-line eye movement measurements. The analyses of viewing patterns, viewing times, and reaction times showed that participants engaged in a parallel self-terminating search for differences. In addition, the results obtained for objects differing in only one dimension suggest that processing times may depend on the relative codability of the stimulus dimensions. The results are reviewed in a broader framework in view of higher-order processes. We propose that overspecifications of colour, often found in object descriptions, may have an ''early'' visual rather than a ''late'' linguistic origin. In a parallel assessment of the detection materials, participants overspecified the objects' colour substantially more often than their size. We argue that referential overspecifications of colour are largely attributable to mechanisms of visual discrimination.},

In this study, we investigated how comprehension is affected by unnecessary information. The literature is mixed: some studies have found that extra information facilitates comprehension and others reported impairments. We used an attentional-cueing paradigm to assess how quickly participants could orient attention to an object upon hearing a referring expression, such as the red square. If there are two squares differing in color, then the modifier is required. However, if there is only one (red) square, then the modifier is unnecessary. We also recorded event-related potentials (ERPs) in order to investigate online processing. Reaction times were significantly longer for referring expressions that contained extra information, and ERPs revealed a centroparietal negativity (N400) that emerged approximately 200-300. ms after modifier onset. We conclude that referring expressions with an unnecessary pre-nominal modifier impair comprehension performance. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

We observed that colour-mediated shifts in overt attention are primarily due to the perceived surface attributes of the visual objects rather than stored knowledge about the typical colour of the object. In addition our data reveal that conceptual category information is the primary determinant of overt attention if both conceptual category and surface colour competitors are copresent in the visual environment.},

abstract = {If hearers are sensitive to Gricean maxims of Quantity (. Grice, 1975/1989), they should disfavour expressions which give too little or too much information for the unique identification of an intended referent. Accordingly, cooperative speakers are expected to provide all and only as much information as is necessary for their interlocutor to uniquely identify a referent. Engelhardt et al. (2006) report that speakers and hearers are sensitive to under-informativeness but not to over-informativeness. Based on this finding, the authors re-interpret the literature which claims to document pragmatic effects in language comprehension and instead attribute previous findings to structural-lexical biases. We argue that the reason why speakers and hearers seemed insensitive to over-informativeness in Engelhardt et al.'s studies was because certain aspects of their experiments favoured the use of redundant information. Our experiments 1 and 2 manipulate these factors, revealing that hearers are in fact sensitive to violations of over- as well as under-informativeness. A further production experiment shows that speakers do not under- or over-specify when the factors that favoured over-informativeness in Engelhardt et al.'s study are removed. The findings provide evidence that speakers and hearers are sensitive to both Quantity maxims, and suggest that the effects obtained in previous literature should indeed be attributed to pragmatic factors. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Categorizations which humans make of the concrete world are not arbitrary but highly determined. In taxonomies of concrete objects, there is one level of abstraction at which the most basic category cuts are made. Basic categories are those which carry the most information, possess the highest category cue validity, and are, thus, the most differentiated from one another. The four experiments of Part I define basic objects by demonstrating that in taxonomies of common concrete nouns in English based on class inclusion, basic objects are the most inclusive categories whose members: (a) possess significant numbers of attributes in common, (b) have motor programs which are similar to one another, (c) have similar shapes, and (d) can be identified from averaged shapes of members of the class. The eight experiments of Part II explore implications of the structure of categories. Basic objects are shown to be the most inclusive categories for which a concrete image of the category as a whole can be formed, to be the first categorizations made during perception of the environment, to be the earliest categories sorted and earliest named by children, and to be the categories most codable, most coded, and most necessary in language. ?? 1976.},

In the current paper, we study the production of definite target descriptions, and explore several factors that might influence the amount of information that is included in these descriptions. First, we present the results of a large-scale experiment investigating referential overspecification as a function of the properties of a target referent and the communicative setting. The results show that speakers (both in written and oral conditions) tend to provide more information when a target is plural rather than singular, and in domains where the speaker has more referential possibilities to describe the target. However, written and spoken referring expressions do not differ in terms of semantic redundancy.

Recent experimental research has shown evidence of very rapid effects of referential context in resolving local indeterminacies on-line. However, there has been no consensus regarding the nature of these context effects. The current paper summarizes recent work covering a range of phenomena for which referential contrast has been shown to influence on-line processing, including prenominal and post-nominal modification, focus operators, and intonational focus. The results of the body of work suggest that referential context effects are not limited to situations in which the linguistic form of the utterance directly specifies the point of contact with context. Rather, context effects of a pragmatic, Gricean nature appear to be possible, suggesting the relationship between linguistic form and context in rapid on-line processing can be of a very indirect nature.},

Dale and Reiter's Incremental Algorithm (IA) is often thought to be the best algorithm for maximizing the similarity to referring expressions produced by people. We test this hypothesis by eliciting referring expressions from human subjects and computing the similarity between the expressions elicited and the ones generated by algorithms. It turns out that the success of the IA depends substantially on the ''preference order'' (PO) employed by the IA, particularly in complex domains. While some POs cause the IA to produce referring expressions that are very similar to expressions produced by human subjects, others cause the IA to perform worse than its main competitors; moreover, it turns out to be difficult to predict the success of a PO on the basis of existing psycholinguistic findings or frequencies in corpora. We also examine the computational complexity of the algorithms in question and argue that there are no compelling reasons for preferring the IA over some of its main competitors on these grounds. We conclude that future research on the generation of referring expressions should explore alternatives to the IA, focusing on algorithms, inspired by the Greedy Algorithm, which do not work with a fixed PO.},

To help evaluate this view, we can formalize it as the rational speech-act theory: Listeners assume that speakers choose their utterances approximately optimally, and listeners interpret an utterance by using Bayesian inference to "invert" this model of the speaker. We apply this framework to model scalar implicature ("some" implies "not all," and "N" implies "not more than N"). This model predicts an interaction between the speaker's knowledge state and the listener's interpretation. We test these predictions in two experiments and find good fit between model predictions and human judgments.},

This prediction is tested against data from syntactic reduction. A single multilevel logit model analysis of naturally distributed data from a corpus of spontaneous speech is used to assess the effect of information density on complementizer that-mentioning, while simultaneously evaluating the predictions of several influential alternative accounts: availability, ambiguity avoidance, and dependency processing accounts. Information density emerges as an important predictor of speakers' preferences during production. As information is defined in terms of probabilities, it follows that production is probability-sensitive, in that speakers' preferences are affected by the contextual probability of syntactic structures. The merits of a corpus-based approach to the study of language production are discussed as well.},

Ahistorical accounts appeal only to the informativeness and availability of terms and to the current salience of the object's features. Historical accounts appeal in addition to the recency and frequency of past references and to partner-specific conceptualizations of the object that people achieve interactively. Evidence from 3 experiments favors a historical account and suggests that when speakers refer to an object, they are proposing a conceptualization of it, a proposal their addresses may or may not agree to. Once they do establish a shared conceptualization, a conceptual pact, they appeal to it in later references even when they could use simpler references. Over time, speakers simplify conceptual pacts and, when necessary, abandon them for new conceptualizations.},

In the current paper, we study the production of definite target descriptions, and explore several factors that might influence the amount of information that is included in these descriptions. First, we present the results of a large-scale experiment investigating referential overspecification as a function of the properties of a target referent and the communicative setting. The results show that speakers (both in written and oral conditions) tend to provide more information when a target is plural rather than singular, and in domains where the speaker has more referential possibilities to describe the target. However, written and spoken referring expressions do not differ in terms of semantic redundancy. We conclude our paper by discussing the implications of our empirical findings for pragmatic theory and for language production models. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

Recent experimental research has shown evidence of very rapid effects of referential context in resolving local indeterminacies on-line. However, there has been no consensus regarding the nature of these context effects. The current paper summarizes recent work covering a range of phenomena for which referential contrast has been shown to influence on-line processing, including prenominal and post-nominal modification, focus operators, and intonational focus. The results of the body of work suggest that referential context effects are not limited to situations in which the linguistic form of the utterance directly specifies the point of contact with context. Rather, context effects of a pragmatic, Gricean nature appear to be possible, suggesting the relationship between linguistic form and context in rapid on-line processing can be of a very indirect nature.},

abstract = {Categorizations which humans make of the concrete world are not arbitrary but highly determined. In taxonomies of concrete objects, there is one level of abstraction at which the most basic category cuts are made. Basic categories are those which carry the most information, possess the highest category cue validity, and are, thus, the most differentiated from one another. The four experiments of Part I define basic objects by demonstrating that in taxonomies of common concrete nouns in English based on class inclusion, basic objects are the most inclusive categories whose members: (a) possess significant numbers of attributes in common, (b) have motor programs which are similar to one another, (c) have similar shapes, and (d) can be identified from averaged shapes of members of the class. The eight experiments of Part II explore implications of the structure of categories. Basic objects are shown to be the most inclusive categories for which a concrete image of the category as a whole can be formed, to be the first categorizations made during perception of the environment, to be the earliest categories sorted and earliest named by children, and to be the categories most codable, most coded, and most necessary in language. ?? 1976.},

Individuals with varying levels of knowledge about songbirds generated lists of attributes, named objects, identified and discriminated among object silhouettes, verified category membership at 4 hierarchical levels, and visually identified songbirds primed either by species-specific, related, or unrelated birdsong. Results indicated that the original basic level never lost its privileged status. Expertise increased access to categorical information at the subordinate level for intermediate experts and at both the subordinate and sub-subordinate levels for advanced experts, causing these sublevels to function as basic. Throughout the continuum of expertise, conceptual knowledge interacted with perception. Accordingly, experts attended to different and more subtle perceptual features than novices.

@article{Tanaka1991,
abstract = {Classic research on conceptual hierarchies has shown that the interaction between the human perceiver and objects in the environment specifies one level of abstraction for categorizing objects, called the basic level, which plays a primary role in cognition. The question of whether the special psychological status of the basic level can be modified by experience was addressed in three experiments comparing the performance of subjects in expert and novice domains. The main findings were that in the domain of expertise (a) subordinate-level categories were as differentiated as the basic-level categories, (b) subordinate-level names were used as frequently as basic-level names for identifying objects, and(c) subordinatelevel categorizations were as fast as basic-level categorizations. Taken together, these results demonstrate that individual differences in domain-specific knowledge affect the extent that the basic level is central to categorization.},

We illustrate reasoning from audience design in the understanding of definite reference, anaphora, and word meaning, and we offer evidence that listeners actually reason this way.

abstract = {Understanding language requires more than the use of fixed conventions and more than decoding combinatorial structure. Instead, comprehenders make exquisitely sensitive inferences about what utterances mean given their knowledge of the speaker, language, and context. Building on developments in game theory and probabilistic modeling, we describe the rational speech act (RSA) framework for pragmatic reasoning. RSA models provide a principled way to formalize inferences about meaning in context; they have been used to make successful quantitative predictions about human behavior in a variety of different tasks and situations, and they explain why complex phenomena, such as hyperbole and vagueness, occur. More generally, they provide a computational framework for integrating linguistic structure, world knowledge, and context in pragmatic language understanding.},

abstract = {A number of recent proposals have used techniques from game theory and Bayesian cognitive science to formalize Gricean pragmatic reasoning (Frank {\&} Goodman, 2012; Franke, 2009; Goodman {\&} Stuhlmuller, 2013; J ¨ ager, 2012). We discuss two phenomena which pose a ¨ challenge to these accounts of pragmatics: M-implicatures (Horn, 1984) and embedded implicatures which violate Hurford's constraint (Chierchia, Fox {\&} Spector, 2012; Hurford, 1974). Previous models cannot derive these implicatures, because of basic limitations in their architecture. In order to explain these phenomena, we propose a realignment of the division between semantic content and pragmatic content. Under this proposal, the semantic content of an utterance is not fixed independent of pragmatic inference; rather, pragmatic inference partially determines an utterance's semantic content. We show how semantic inference can be realized as an extension to the Rational Speech Acts framework (Goodman {\&} Stuhlmuller, 2013). The ¨ addition of lexical uncertainty derives both M-implicatures and the relevant embedded implicatures, and preserves the derivations of more standard implicatures.},

@article{kamp1995,
abstract = {Osherson and Smith (1981, Cognition, 11, 237-262) discuss a number of problems which arise for a prototype-based account of the meanings of simple and complex concepts. Assuming that concept combination in such a theory is to be analyzed in terms of fuzzy logic, they show that some complex concepts inevitably get assigned the wrong meanings. In the present paper we argue that many of the problems O{\&}S discovered are due to difficulties that are intrinsic to fuzzy set theory, and that most of them disappear when fuzzy logic is replaced by supervaluation theory. However, even after this replacement one of O{\&}S's central problems remains: the theory still predicts that the degree to which an object is an instance of, say, "stripped apple" must be less than or equal to both the degree to which it is an instance of "striped" and the degree to which it is an instance of "apple", but this constraint conflicts with and the degree to which it is an instance of "apple", but this constraint conflicts with O{\&}S's experimental results. The second part of the paper explores ways of solving this and related problems. This leads us to suggest a number of distinctions and principles concerning how prototypicality and other mechanisms interact and which seem important for semantics generally. Prominent among these are (i) the distinction between on the one hand the logical and semantic properties of concepts and on the other the linguistic that between concepts for which the extension is determined by their prototype and concepts for which extension and prototypicality are independent.},
